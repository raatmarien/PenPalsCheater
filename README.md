# PerfectPenPals
Will calculate a perfect seed for Pietdagamers game Pen Pals

Link to the game: https://github.com/Pietdagamer/PenPals

The program will attempt to generate a name to accompany the seed for you, but this often doesn't work, if so you will have to think up a name which will generate the seed yourself, the code that converts a string to a seed is here: https://github.com/Pietdagamer/PenPals/blob/master/src/Character.cpp#L20
